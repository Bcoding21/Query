# Query
Reads a file of words and links mapped to id numbers and file of word ID numbers to link ID numbers.
Searches for a word or group of words supplied by the user.
Inspiration for this project came from the same project I worked on at Howard West. 
In the original project the code was written in java with a front end webstie written in angular,
where the user could enter words in a search bar. In this version users enter search terms on the command line.
